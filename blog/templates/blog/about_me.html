             <p>Your most welcome to read my articles in this blog. I usually post articles related to programming and more specifically python program. If your interested to start learning python, this is great platform to get started. I am a part time coder as i am so much interested in programming and i currently work in Bhutan Power Coporation Ltd as electrical engineer. i have Bachelor Degree Power Engineering from Jigme Namgyel Engineering college.</p>
              <h4>Here is my Story, how i started coding!</h4>
              <p>Some of you might be interested to hear my journey in field of programming. Until grade 12 i had no idea what actually coding and programming is, as well as never heard people talking about it. Back than, i remember when my IT teacher gave me his laptop to use, unfortunately it was my first time that i got chance to touch and feel laptop. Guess what? it was quite upsetting and great insult to me that i couldn't operate and get started with laptop computer. so, all it started when i was in college pursuing my degree. That time i was all set to get started with coding as i had brand new laptop and enough basic knowledge to start coding. During my degree, we were taught C++ programming and i started developing so much interest in coding. i feel great and satisfied that i reached this point in my life as self-taught programmer. It is all about my interest and passion to learn with consistent hard work. I am still learning and want to learn more to keep pace with fast-moving technology in field of computer science</p>
               <p>This blog is created in line with my objectives to share my skills and knowledge for everyone who is interested to code. I am not experienced and expert in this field, but i want to share and help people with whatever i known. My interest is in machine learning, data science, AI and web development. I have python skills and some working experience with my own projects. In this blog, you will find articles mostly related to python starting from basics to advance. You can read articles and set up your own environment to try hands-on experience.There are lots resources in internet today to learn coding either paid or free. if you have interest, passion, determination and time to code, consistently work towards your dream. Everyday keep learning and i will grantee that you will see yourself improving.</p>
